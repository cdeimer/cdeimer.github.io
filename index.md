## Professional Highlights

* Wrote a process in Java using Spark that allowed my team to build lists of tens of millions of customers in a small fraction of the original time (~4% compared to the legacy process). This reduced the time spent troubleshooting this process by both my team and our stakeholders to essentially zero.
* Led an initiative to rewrite old, poorly scalable SQL code, saving the team time and reducing CPU strain on the server.
* Acted as primary frontend developer in a Datatech engineering group, on top of my responsibilities as a SQL performance engineer.

## Interests and Hobbies

* Trumpet player, alum of the Boston University Marching Band and Pep Band
* Amateur cruciverbalist
* Once the #9 ranked _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ player at BU
